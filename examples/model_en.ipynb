    "\n",
    "Suppose we have a manufacturing plant which produces several products (eg. named as `A`, `B`, `C`, `D`, etc).\n",

    "The technology to make these products can be chained: for example to produce `A` some quantity of \n",
    "`B` is needed, for `B` one needs some quantitiy of `C` and `D`, etc. \n",

    "At the start the planning period, we kbow all orders for  products to be shipped by day and price of shipment. \n",

    "\n",
    "- A binary variable (0 or 1) assigned to identify whether to accept or reject a order.\n",

    "- Direct requirements for producing each product are given (intermediate use).\n",
    "\n",
